About
===========

[edhrec](http://edhrec.com) is a service that makes card recommendations for [Magic: The Gathering](http://magic.wizards.com/) [EDH](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=magic/rules/edh) decks.

Recommendations are generated by the [edhrec bot](https://github.com/donaldpminer/edhrec), which uses a collaborative filtering algorithm to suggest cards to add/cut.

The website is an [AngularJs](http://angularjs.org) application and connects to the [edhrec bot](https://github.com/donaldpminer/edhrec) via XHRs.
