About
===========

[edhrec.com](http://edhrec.com) is a service that generates card recommendations for [Magic: The Gathering](http://magic.wizards.com/) [EDH](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=magic/rules/edh) decks.

Recommendations are provided by the [edhrec bot](https://github.com/donaldpminer/edhrec), which uses [collaborative filtering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) to determine which cards you should consider adding/cutting.

The website is an [AngularJs](http://angularjs.org) application and connects to the [edhrec bot](https://github.com/donaldpminer/edhrec) via XHRs.

Installation
